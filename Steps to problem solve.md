# Steps to problem solve
1) Understand the problem
- can you produce your own input-output pair
- think of simple cases as well as worst-caase scenarios

2) Design your solution
- flowchart
- concept map
- programming pattern

3) Write your program
- have a clear picture of what Python construct to ouse
- have a clear picture of how to connect the elements
- translate into Python code

4) Test your program
- run test cases as well as your additional test cases
- understand why a test case fails
- repeat until all test cases pass 

5) Analyse your solution
- try to create cases to make your code fail
- if yes, understand problem and repeat step 1

6) Generalise your solution

7) Record to pattern bank!!
- By generalizing and using a pattern bank, you dont need to remember solutions for every problem

## Common types of errors
- Omitting return statement
- Incompatible types 
- Incorrect number of arguments
- Arithmetic error (eg ZeroDivisionError)
- Undeclared variables
- Syntax error
