# Steps to problem solve
1. **Understand the problem**
   - can you produce your own input-output pair
   - think of simple cases as well as worst-caase scenarios

2. **Design your solution**
- flowchart
- concept map
- programming pattern
   **Common Techniques**  
   - 1) **Guess and Check**

   - 2) **Connecting the dots**
     - Finding connections between one input and the next

   - 3) **Exploration**
     - Start with a series of relevant inputs
     - Find the relationship between outputs from the relevant inputs 
       - Difference (+ or -)
       - Ratio (* or /)
       - Remainder (% or //)
     - Find the operation to TRANSFORM an input to its RELEVANT input

   - 4) **Programming Patterns**
     - Using common patterns from previous problems

3. **Write your program**
   - have a clear picture of what Python construct to use
   - have a clear picture of how to connect the elements
   - translate into Python code

4. **Test your program**
   - run test cases as well as your additional test cases
   - understand why a test case fails
   - repeat until all test cases pass 

5. **Analyse your solution**
   - try to create cases to make your code fail
   - if yes, understand problem and repeat step 1

6. **Generalise your solution**

7. **Record to pattern bank!!**
   - By generalizing and using a pattern bank, you dont need to remember solutions for every problem

## Common types of errors
- Omitting return statement
- Incompatible types 
- Incorrect number of arguments
- Arithmetic error (eg ZeroDivisionError)
- Undeclared variables
- Syntax error
- Statements after returns will not excute
- Infinite loop 
 - Especially in recursion if base case is never met

--- 

## Debugging techniques

- Print intermediate values
